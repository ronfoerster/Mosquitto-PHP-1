# Mosquitto-PHP

This is an extension to allow using the [Eclipse Mosquittoâ„¢ MQTT client library](http://mosquitto.org) with PHP. See the `examples/` directory for usage.

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/ronfoerster/Mosquitto-PHP-1/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ronfoerster/Mosquitto-PHP-1/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

## PHP 8.1 support
* corrected Test-Files for PHP-8.1
* Example Dockerfiles
* Github Actions 

## Requirements

* PHP 8.x
* libmosquitto

## Installation

If you've used a pre-built package to install Mosquitto, you need to make sure you have the development headers installed. On Red Hat-derived systems, this is probably called `libmosquitto-devel`, and on Debian-based systems it will be `libmosquitto-dev`.
Example Ubuntu:
````
sudo apt update && apt install libmosquitto-dev
````
Please download the source packages from our releases or use git:
````
git clone https://github.com/ronfoerster/Mosquitto-PHP-1.git && \
cd Mosquitto-PHP-1
````
Configure, compile and install at the source folder:
````
phpize
./configure 
make
make install
````
Then add `extension=mosquitto.so` to your `php.ini`. The path of the used ini-Files can you get with the command `php --ini`.

The `./configure --with-mosquitto=/path/to/mosquitto` argument is optional, and only required if your libmosquitto install cannot be found. 

## General operation

The underlying library is based on callbacks and asynchronous operation. As such, you have to call the `loop()` method of the `Client` frequently to permit the library to handle the messages in its queues. Also, you should use the callback functions to ensure that you only attempt to publish after the client has connected, etc. For example, here is how you would correctly publish a QoS=2 message:

```php
<?php

use Mosquitto\Client;

$mid = 0;
$c = new Mosquitto\Client("PHP");
$c->onLog('var_dump');
$c->onConnect(function() use ($c, &$mid) {
    $mid = $c->publish("mgdm/test", "Hello", 2);
});

$c->onPublish(function($publishedId) use ($c, $mid) {
    if ($publishedId == $mid) {
        $c->disconnect();
    }
});

$c->connect("localhost");
$c->loopForever();

echo "Finished"
```
